# prandtlAirfoils
Aerodynamic analysis on all airfoils used in the Prandtl investigation.


To do:
Insert benchmark results with NACA 23012
 - Abbot & von Doenhoff windtunnel
 - Then XFOIL
 - Then CFD
 - Then write up this results
 
Then proceed to the following tasks:

Analyse HQ36 and document with XFOIL
Analyse Prandtl root and tip and document with XFOIL
Write LaTeX macro to plot drag polar.
CFD all profiles.  Use OpenFoam
Also plot over windtunnel results of the HQ profiles and the NACA23012
Compare windtunnel, CFD and XFOIL.  Check how close predictions are.
